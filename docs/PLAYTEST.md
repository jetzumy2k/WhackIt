# Playtest Checklist

Unit specs cover the rules; these checks cover what only a live server shows.
Record the date, build (commit) and result for each run in the PR.

## Setup
1. `scripts\check.ps1` (builds `build\WhackItOut.rbxl`).
2. In Studio, close any open copy of the place, then **File → Open from File** → `build\WhackItOut.rbxl`.
   The place has its own floor and spawn (`Workspace.Arena`). If you instead `rojo serve` into a
   place that already has a Baseplate, delete one of the two floors.
3. Open **View → Output** (newer Studio: **Window → Output**).

## Phase 2: shared boss loop

### Solo (Test → Play, F5)
| # | Check | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Spawn | Floor; an orange cartoon monster with angry eyes, a toothy mouth and a "DUE TODAY!" sign, bobbing and turning to face you, with name + HP bar `100 / 100`. You hold a red-and-yellow hammer. HUD shows `Stress 100 / 100`, `Score: 0`, hint at the bottom; no hotbar |
| 2 | Click while far from the boss | Your character swings the hammer (animation + swish sound), "Get closer to the boss!" appears above the hint, the boss doesn't react |
| 3 | Walk up and click | A full swing: hammer raised over the shoulder, body leans back, then a fast downward strike with a swish, a little follow-through, back to holding; the boss flashes white, leans back with a hop, yellow `-10` floats up, small camera shake, HP `90 / 100`, stress drops by 1 |
| 3b | Hammer orientation | The handle sticks out past your fist with the head at the far end (never back along your forearm), and on the downswing the head comes forward and down into the boss. **Report if the hammer points the wrong way.** |
| 4 | Click as fast as possible | Swings complete one after another (never cut off mid-swing); about 2 hits per second land |
| 5 | Defeat the boss | HP bar shows `DEFEATED!`, the monster spins and shrinks away, Victory Card `+100 score -5 stress`, Score `100` in HUD and player list |
| 6 | Wait ~5 s | A fresh boss at `100 / 100` replaces it; hitting works again |
| 7 | Reset character (Esc → Reset) mid-fight | You respawn holding a new hammer; HUD and HP bars stay; hitting works again |
| 8 | Output window | No red errors. No `[Remote] rejected` warnings during normal play. In Studio the server prints `[Combat] hit from <name> ignored: <reason>` (max once/s) for swings that don't land, e.g. `out of reach (10.2 > 9 studs)`. If a hit you expected doesn't land, copy that line into your report. If the arm doesn't swing, look for `[SwingAnimator] no right-shoulder joint …` and include it |

### Shared boss (Test → Clients and Servers → 2 or 3 players → Start)
| # | Check | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| 9 | Both players hit the same boss | Both see the same HP and each other's swings; each sees their own hits in yellow, the other's in grey; the monster turns to face each viewer |
| 10 | Player A deals most damage, player B ≥ 1 hit (≥ 10 HP) | Both get `+100 score` Victory Cards |
| 11 | Player B never hits the boss | B gets no Victory Card and no score (the below-10%-share case is covered by `BossState` specs) |
| 12 | Both hit on the defeating moment | Exactly one defeat; each qualifying player rewarded once |
| 13 | A player leaves mid-fight | No errors; the remaining player can finish and is rewarded |

### Abuse (server Output)
| # | Check | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| 14 | Hold an autoclicker on the boss | Hit rate stays at the cooldown; no errors |
| 15 | From the client command bar: `game.ReplicatedStorage.Remotes.Combat.RequestHammerHit:FireServer("nope")` | No hit; no error |
| 16 | Same with `FireServer(123)`, `FireServer({})`, `FireServer(string.rep("a", 1000))` | `[Remote] rejected RequestHammerHit … invalid bossInstanceId` (throttled), no hit |
| 17 | `for i = 1, 200 do …:FireServer("boss-1") end` from far away | No damage; `rate limited` warning at most once per 5 s |
